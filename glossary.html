  <div align="center" class="header1"><a name="glossary">Glossary of Clinical Trials Terms</a></div>
  <br/>

  The following glossary was prepared to help the consumer become familiar with
  many of the common terms used in clinical trials.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="adverse">ADVERSE REACTION:</a> (Adverse Event.) An
  unwanted effect caused by the administration of drugs. Onset may be sudden or
  develop over time (See <a class="header3" href="#side">Side Effects</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="advocacy">ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT GROUPS:</a>
  Organizations and groups that actively support
  participants and their families with valuable resources, including
  self-empowerment and survival tools.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="approved">APPROVED DRUGS:</a> In the U.S., the Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve a substance as a drug before it can
  be marketed. The approval process involves several steps including pre-clinical
  laboratory and animal studies, clinical trials for safety and efficacy, filing
  of a New Drug Application by the manufacturer of the drug, FDA review of the
  application, and FDA approval/rejection of application
  (See <a class="header3" href="#fda">Food and Drug Administration</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="arm">ARM:</a> Any of the treatment groups in a randomized
  trial. Most randomized trials have two "arms," but some have three "arms," or
  even more (See <a class="header3" href="#randomt">Randomized Trial</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="baseline">BASELINE:</a> 1. Information gathered at
  the beginning of a study from which variations found in the study are measured.
  2. A known value or quantity with which an unknown is compared when measured or
  assessed. 3. The initial time point in a clinical trial, just before a
  participant starts to receive the experimental treatment which is being tested.
  At this reference point, measurable values such as CD4 count are recorded.
  Safety and efficacy of a drug are often determined by monitoring changes from
  the baseline values.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="bias">BIAS:</a>
  When a point of view prevents impartial judgment on issues relating to the
  subject of that point of view. In
  clinical studies, bias is controlled by blinding and randomization (See <a class="header3" href="#blind">Blind</a>
  and <a class="header3" href="#randomization">Randomization</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="blind">BLIND:</a> A randomized trial is "Blind" if the participant
  is not told which arm of the trial he is on. A clinical trial is "Blind"
  if participants are unaware on whether they are in the experimental or
  control arm of the study; also called masked. (See <a class="header3" href="#single">Single Blind Study </a>and
  <a class="header3" href="#double">Double Blind Study</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="clinical">CLINICAL:</a> Pertaining to or founded on
  observation and treatment of participants, as distinguished from theoretical or
  basic science.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="cendpoint">CLINICAL ENDPOINT:</a>

  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="investigator">CLINICAL INVESTIGATOR:</a>
  A medical researcher in charge of carrying out a clinical
  trial's protocol.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="ctrial">CLINICAL TRIAL:</a> A clinical trial is a research study to answer
  specific questions about vaccines or new therapies or new ways of using known
  treatments. Clinical trials (also called medical research and research studies)
  are used to determine whether new drugs or treatments are both safe and
  effective. Carefully conducted clinical trials are the fastest and safest way
  to find treatments that work in people. Trials are in four phases: Phase I tests
  a new drug or treatment in a small group; Phase II expands the study to a larger
  group of people; Phase III expands the study to an even larger group of people;
  and Phase IV takes place after the drug or treatment has been licensed and marketed.
  (See <a class="header3" href="#phasel">Phase I</a>,
  <a class="header3" href="#phasell">II</a>,
  <a class="header3" href="#phaselll">III</a>,
  and <a class="header3" href="#phaselv">IV Trials</a>).<br/>

  than academic research facilities.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="compassionate">COMPASSIONATE USE:</a> A method of providing experimental
  therapeutics prior to final FDA approval for use in humans. This procedure is
  used with very sick individuals who have no other treatment options. Often,
  case-by-case approval must be obtained from the FDA for "compassionate use" of
  a drug or therapy.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="alternative">COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPY:</a>
  Broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies that
  Western (conventional) medicine does not commonly use to promote
  well-being or treat health conditions. Examples include acupuncture,
  herbs, etc.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="completed">COMPLETED:</a>
  See <a class="header3" href="#recruitment">Recruitment Status</a><br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="confidentiality">CONFIDENTIALITY REGARDING TRIAL PARTICIPANTS:</a>
  Refers to maintaining the confidentiality of trial participants
  including their personal identity and all personal medical
  information. The trial participants' consent to the use of records for
  data verification purposes should be obtained prior to the trial and
  assurance must be given that confidentiality will be maintained.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="group">CONTROL GROUP:</a> The standard by which
  experimental observations are evaluated.  In many clinical trials, one
  group of patients will be given an experimental drug or treatment, while
  the control group is given either a standard treatment for the illness or a
  placebo (See <a class="header3" href="#placebo">Placebo</a> and
  <a class="header3" href="#standard">Standard Treatment</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="contrials">CONTROLLED TRIALS:</a> Control is a
  standard against which experimental observations may be evaluated. In clinical
  trials, one group of participants is given an experimental drug, while another
  group (i.e., the control group) is given either a standard treatment for the
  disease or a placebo.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="dsmb">DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARD (DSMB):</a>
  An independent committee, composed of community representatives and clinical
  research experts, that reviews data while a clinical trial is in progress to
  ensure that participants are not exposed to undue risk. A DSMB may recommend
  that a trial be stopped if there are safety concerns or if the trial objectives
  have been achieved.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="diagnostic">DIAGNOSTIC TRIALS: </a>Refers to trials

  which two or more doses of an agent (such as a drug) are tested against each
  other to determine which dose works best and is least harmful.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="double">DOUBLE-BLIND STUDY:</a> A clinical trial
  design in which neither the participating individuals nor the study staff knows
  which participants are receiving the experimental drug and which are receiving
  a placebo (or another therapy). Double-blind trials are thought to produce
  objective results, since the expectations of the doctor and the participant
  about the experimental drug do not affect the outcome; also called double-masked
  study. See <a class="header3" href="#blind">Blinded Study</a>,
  <a class="header3" href="#single">Single-Blind Study</a>, and
  <a class="header3" href="#placebo">Placebo</a>.<br/>

  an increase or a decrease in the action of either substance, or it may be an
  adverse effect that is not normally associated with either drug.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3">DSMB:</a> See <a class="header3" href="#dsmb">Data Safety and Monitoring Board</a>.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="efficacy">EFFICACY:</a> (Of a drug or treatment). The
  maximum ability of a drug or treatment to produce a result regardless of
  dosage. A drug passes efficacy trials if it is effective at the dose tested and
  against the illness for which it is prescribed. In the procedure mandated by
  the FDA, Phase II clinical trials gauge efficacy, and Phase III trials confirm
  it (See <a class="header3" href="#fda">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a>,
  <a class="header3" href="#phasell"> Phase II</a> and
  <a class="header3" href="#phaselll">III Trials</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="eligibility">ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:</a>
  Summary criteria for participant selection; includes Inclusion and Exclusion
  criteria. (See <a class="header3" href="#inclusion">Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</a>)<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="expanded">EXPANDED ACCESS:</a> Refers to any of the
  FDA procedures, such as compassionate use, parallel track, and treatment IND
  that distribute experimental drugs to participants who are failing on currently
  available treatments for their condition and also are unable to participate in

  investigation.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="inclusion">INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: </a>The
  medical or social standards determining whether a person may or may not be
  allowed to enter a clinical trial. These criteria are based on such factors as
  age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and

  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="informed">INFORMED CONSENT:</a> The process of
  learning the key facts about a clinical trial before deciding
  whether or not to participate. It is also a continuing process throughout the
  study to provide information for participants. To help someone decide whether
  or not to participate, the doctors and nurses involved in the trial explain the
  details of the study.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="icd">INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT: </a>A document that describes
  the rights of the study participants, and includes details about the study,
  such as its purpose, duration, required procedures, and key contacts. Risks and
  potential benefits are explained in the informed consent document. The participant
  then decides whether or not to sign the document. Informed consent is not a contract,
  and the participant may withdraw from the trial at any time.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="institutional">INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB):</a> 1. A
  committee of physicians, statisticians, researchers, community advocates, and
  others that ensures that a clinical trial is ethical and that the rights of
  study participants are protected. All clinical trials in the U.S. must be
  approved by an IRB before they begin. 2. Every institution that conducts or
  supports biomedical or behavioral research involving human participants must, by
  federal regulation, have an IRB that initially approves and periodically reviews
  the research in order to protect the rights of human participants.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="intent">INTENT TO TREAT:</a> Analysis of clinical

  administered.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="orphan">ORPHAN DRUGS:</a> An FDA category that
  refers to medications used to treat diseases and conditions that occur rarely.
  There is little financial incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to develop
  medications for these diseases or conditions. Orphan drug status, however,
  gives a manufacturer specific financial incentives to develop and provide such
  medications.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="peer">PEER REVIEW: </a>Review of a clinical trial by experts
  chosen by the study sponsor. These
  experts review the trials for scientific merit, participant safety, and ethical

  living organism) of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a
  drug or vaccine.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="phasel">PHASE I TRIALS:</a> Initial studies to
  determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of drugs in humans,
  the side effects associated with increasing doses, and to gain early evidence
  of effectiveness; may include healthy participants and/or patients.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="phasell">PHASE II TRIALS: </a>Controlled
  clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug
  for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease
  or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side
  effects and risks. <br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="phaselll">PHASE III TRIALS:</a> Expanded controlled
  and uncontrolled trials after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness
  of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather additional information
  to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and provide and
  adequate basis for physician labeling. <br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="phaselv">PHASE IV TRIALS:</a> Post-marketing
  studies to delineate additional information including the drug's risks,
  benefits, and optimal use. <br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="placebo">PLACEBO:</a> A placebo is an inactive pill,
  liquid, or powder that has no treatment value. In clinical trials, experimental
  treatments are often compared with placebos to assess the treatment's
  effectiveness. (See <a class="header3" href="#placeboc">Placebo Controlled Study</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="placeboc">PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY:</a> A method of investigation
  of drugs in which an inactive substance (the placebo) is given to one group of

  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="prevention">PREVENTION TRIALS: </a>Refers
  to trials to find better ways to prevent disease in people who have never had
  the disease or to prevent a disease from returning. These approaches may include
  medicines, vaccines, vitamins, minerals, or lifestyle changes.<br/>
  <br/>


  <a class="header3" name="protocols">PROTOCOL:</a> A study plan on which all
  clinical trials are based. The plan is carefully designed to safeguard
  the health of the participants as well as answer specific research questions. A
  protocol describes what types of people may participate in the trial; the
  schedule of tests, procedures, medications, and dosages; and the length of the
  study. While in a clinical trial, participants following a protocol are seen
  regularly by the research staff to monitor their health and to determine the
  safety and effectiveness of their treatment (See
  <a class="header3" href="#inclusion">Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="quality">QUALITY OF LIFE TRIALS (or Supportive Care trials): </a>
  Refers to trials that explore ways to improve comfort and quality of life for
  individuals with a chronic illness.<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="randomization">RANDOMIZATION: </a>A method based on chance by which study participants are
  assigned to a treatment group. Randomization minimizes the differences among
  groups by equally distributing people with particular characteristics among all
  the trial arms. The researchers do not know which treatment is better. From
  what is known at the time, any one of the treatments chosen could be of benefit
  to the participant (See <a class="header3" href="#arm">Arm</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="randomt">RANDOMIZED TRIAL:</a> A study in which
  participants are randomly (i.e., by chance) assigned to one of two or more
  treatment arms of a clinical trial. Occasionally placebos are utilized. (See
  <a class="header3" href="#arm">Arm</a>
  and <a class="header3" href="#placebo">Placebo</a>).<br/>
  <br/>

  <a class="header3" name="recruiting">RECRUITING:</a> The period during which a trial
  is attempting to identify and enroll participants.  Recruitment activites can include
  advertising and other ways of solicting interest from possible particpants.
  (See <a class="header3" href="#recruitment">recruitment status</a>
  and <a class="header3" href="#enrolling">enrolling</a>).<br/>
  <br/>


  <a class="header3" name="recruitment">RECRUITMENT STATUS:</a>
  Indicates the current stage of a trial, whether it is planned, ongoing, or completed.
  Possible values include:
  <ul>
