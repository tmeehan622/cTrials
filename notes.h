The search results list can be obtained in XML format by appending a URL parameter, "displayxml=true", to the end of a search request URL.
Example:   http://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=%22lyme+disease%22&displayxml=true
By default, this option will return the first 20 search results. A parameter, "count=100", can be used to get the first 100 results. Another parameter, "start=101", can be used to get subsequent sets of studies.
In the following example, all three parameters are used to get results 1201-1400 out of more than 16,000 results found by a search of "cancer".
Example:   http://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=%22cancer%22&displayxml=true&count=200&start=1201


For XML you add this parameter
&displayxml=true

<brief_summary>
<textblock>
This is a multicentre, randomized, open-label, phase II study testing GIVINOSTAT (ITF2357) in
combination with hydroxyurea in a population of patients with JAK2V617F positive Polycythemia
Vera non-responders to the maximum tolerated dose of hydroxyurea monotherapy for at least 3
months.

Recruited patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:

-  group A: 50 mg o.d. of oral GIVINOSTAT (ITF2357) in combination with the maximum
tolerated dose of hydroxyurea monotherapy already in use before admission to the study;

-  group B: 50 mg b.i.d. of oral GIVINOSTAT (ITF2357) in combination with the maximum
tolerated dose of hydroxyurea monotherapy already in use before admission to the study.
The two groups will be balanced for number and for Centre in order to provide valuable
information on both treatment regimens. In both groups assigned doses shall remain
stable until week 12, which is when the primary endpoint is assessed, unless specific
tolerability issues arise which impose dose reduction. After the primary endpoint
assessment at week 12, one of the following treatment schedules will be chosen case by
case on the basis of the achieved clinical response and continued for up to 12 further
weeks:

-  Partial or Complete Response at week 12:

-  group A: continue 50 mg o.d.;

-  group B: continue 50 mg b.i.d.;

-  No Response at week 12:

-  group A: increase to 50 mg b.i.d.;

-  group B: increase to 50 mg t.i.d.. At any time during study course, if toxicity is
observed, GIVINOSTAT (ITF2357) treatment will be discontinued until recovery and then
restarted at a reduced dose level. The drug will be definitively withdrawn in case of
reappearance of toxicity even at a reduced daily dose. Overall, the treatment will last
up to a maximum of 24 cumulative weeks of drug administration. The study will recruit
subjects of both genders with an established diagnosis of JAK2V617F positive
Polycythemia Vera according to the revised WHO criteria, in need of cytoreductive
therapy, non-responders to the maximum tolerated dose of hydroxyurea monotherapy for at
least 3 months.
